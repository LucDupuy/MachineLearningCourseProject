Normalize the data to between 0 and 1: Take the images (x_train and x_test) and divide by 255 (max RGB value)

Classification Array Mapping Object to Index -> ["enemy", "teammate"] would set the label of images with enemies as 0
and images with enemies as 1

Build the Neural Network
**************************

Convolutional Filters for features (horse has long legs, cat has point ears, plane has wings, truck is bigger then car)
-> Multiple layers of neurons, ending with a layer of 2 neurons, representing probability of image being something
-> First layer in input, then are the hidden layers, then the last layer is the output layer
-> "relu activation function": If value is negative, say 0, if positive, return that value (in contrast to sigmoid
function). This is how the neurons works

-> Max Pooling summarizes (down-samples) the layers to make it easier to work with

Max Pooling Layer reduces image to essential information


Testing Your Model
*******************
After building the neural network, find some test images that the model has not yet seen

prediction = model.predict(np.array([image to test]) / 255)
index = np.argmax(prediction)
print(prediction)
